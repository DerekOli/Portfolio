            Hello, My name is Derek Olive. I am a highly motivated and detail-oritented individual. I enjoy learning new things and am driven by a passion for technology and analytics.

            This website provides additional detail about my professional experience and
            education beyond what fits on a résumé while also highlighting my skills and hobbies as an 
			individual.
